# RDS vs. DynamoDB Practicum

## Project Overview

This project undertakes a comparative analysis of relational database systems (RDS) and Amazon DynamoDB for managing historical student enrollment data from Andrews University spanning the last decade. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of these two distinct database solutions in a scenario characterized by infrequent data access, specifically when student records may only be queried approximately once per year.

By experimenting with real-world enrollment data, this practicum aims to:
- Assess the performance characteristics of both RDS and DynamoDB under read-heavy, low-frequency access patterns.
- Quantify the cost implications associated with each database solution for the defined use case.
- Determine which database system offers a more optimal balance of performance, scalability, and economic viability for archival or seldom-accessed educational institutional data.

This research will provide valuable insights for institutions considering modernizing their data storage strategies, particularly for historical or infrequently accessed datasets where traditional relational models might incur unnecessary overhead.
